## Project Description

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project is the first step towards building a full web application, emulating the functionality of the popular Airbnb platform. The primary goal of this initial phase is to develop a command interpreter that manages AirBnB objects. The command interpreter will play a crucial role in subsequent tasks, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.
